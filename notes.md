1. Python is:
a) dynamically typed (it keeps track of types for you automatically instead of requiring declaration code)
b) strongly typed (you can perform on an object only operations that are valid for its type)


2.  xdg-open   #Detect the default appropriate viewer and open the file with it (bash)

3. Use dir(object) function to return a list of all attributes available for given object

Names with underscores in received list represent the implementation of the object and are available to support customization. 
In general, leading and trailing double underscores is the naming pattern Python uses for implementation
details. The names without the underscores are the callable methods on particular object.

4. Empty Dir() gives methods' names. Use help() to ask what they do. For example help(dir) or help(spam.replace)
