1. methods: own operations/functions attached to the object, which are triggered with a call expression

2. dictionary = mapping

3. Iteration Protocol: a pervasive idea in Python that essentially means 
a physically stored sequence in memory, or an object that generates one item at a time in the context of an iteration operation.  
Every Python tool that scancs an object from left to right uses Iteration Protocol

4. class: define new types of objects that extend the core set

5. immutable: object that cannot be changed after it is created.
Numbers, strings, and tuples in Python fall into this category

6. Sequence: a positionally ordered collection of objects. 
Strings, lists, and tuples are all sequences in Python

7. polymorphism: indicating that the meaning of an operation depends on the type of the objects being operated on
